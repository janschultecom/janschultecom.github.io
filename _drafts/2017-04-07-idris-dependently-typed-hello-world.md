Inspired by the chapter on equality in [Edwin Brady's](https://edwinb.wordpress.com/) amazing book [Type-Driven Development with Idris](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris) (which I highly recommend you to read), I wanted to create a [dependently-typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dependent_type&oldid=774017617) version of *Hello World!* in Idris. The basic idea is to have my hello world program only compile for the exact String *Hello World!* and nothing else. 

So here it is: 
```idris
data Sentence : String -> Type where
  Phrase : (s:String) -> Sentence s 

say : Sentence "Hello World!" -> IO ()
say _ = printLn "Hello World!"

main : IO ()
main = say ( Phrase "Hello World!" )
```

Now if we are going to write any other String than "Hello World!" like "Hallo Welt!"...
```idris
main = say ( Phrase "Hallo Welt!" )
```
... we get a compile-time error:
```bash
When checking argument s to constructor Main.Phrase:
        Type mismatch between
                "Hello World!" (Inferred value)
        and
                "Hallo Welt!" (Given value)
```

## Explanation

Let's analyse the different steps. The first line ...
```idris
data Sentence : String -> Type where
```
... declares a data type. Just as a List can take a *type* like Int to create a more specific type List Int, our Sentence data type takes a *value* of type String to create another more specific type. 

Line two declares our only type constructor Phrase. 
```idris
  Phrase : (s:String) -> Sentence s 
```
The Phrase constructor takes a String and to create a type Sentence. Using Phrase and passing it some String is the only way to create a type Sentence.

Line three defines a function that takes a type Sentence "Hello World!" and returns an I/O action. 
```idris
say : Sentence "Hello World!" -> IO ()
```
Note that we have a String value in our type declaration. 

Line five and six define our actual Hello World! program in Idris. Here we define our main routine to print out Hello World!. It does that by calling the funcntion say with the Phrase "Hello World!" 
```idris
main : IO ()
main = say ( Phrase "Hello World!" )
```
As described above, changing this line to another String results in a compile-time error.

## Variant - Built-in (=) type

An alternative approach to achieve the same result is to use the built-in (=) type of Idris. 
```idris
say : (=) "Hello World!" "Hello World!" -> IO ()
say _ = printLn "Hello World!"

main : IO ()
main = say ( Refl { x = "Hello World!" } )
```
Our say function now expects an (=) type with the String *Hello World!*
```idris
say : (=) "Hello World!" "Hello World!" -> IO ()
```
The only way to create it is by using creating a Refl with the String *Hello World!*.
```idris
main = say ( Refl { x = "Hello World!" } )
```

## Variant 2 - Built-in (=) type with auto implicits

We can take this approach one step further by introducing an implicit (=) parameter into our say funcion. 
```idris
say : (s:String) -> { auto ok : (=) s "Hello World!"} -> IO ()
say s = printLn s

main : IO ()
main = say "Hello World!"
```
Calling the function say requires a String and an implicit proof that the input String is equal to *Hello World!*.
```idris
say : (s:String) -> { auto ok : (=) s "Hello World!"} -> IO ()
```
The only way the compiler can create this proof is for the String *Hello World!*. Anything else will fail to compile.
```idris
main = say "Hello World!"
```
