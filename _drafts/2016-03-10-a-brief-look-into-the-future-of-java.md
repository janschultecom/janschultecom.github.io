As type-inference was just proposed as a [JEP 286](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/286), many developers are wondering what the future of java might look like. Fortunately, an anonymous person (who refers himself just as Mister S) leaked to me a series of roadmap documents from large software companies. In a painstaking work with numerous sleepless nights, I was able to put together the different puzzle pieces into a timeline of whats going to expect us in the future.

* 01/04/2017: java 9 introduces type-inference.
* 02/04/2017: all over the world OCaml developers are hospitalised with concussion due to heavy head shaking.
* 2020: java 10 introduces the *object* keyword. A heavy fight surges among wikipedians whether the numerous implementation examples in the  [Singleton_pattern article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) should be kept as *historic heritage*.
* 2020: dotty is officially released
* 2021: dotty is renamed to scala 3 after complaints continued to grow that Odersky stopped working on scala.
* 2022: Lightbend changes its name to JBend to better meet its customer needs. However, the logo is kept the same.
* 2030: Apple introduces its new programming language *difty*. Jony Ive calls it "truly nifty".
* In the same year: The end of scala 2 LTS is announced.
* 2053: java has fully adapted scala 2.10 features
* Meanwhile: Haskel developers are still wondering wtf everyone else is doing.
* Meanwhile 2: Frege developers do the same but for the jvm
* 2095: java 35 introduces type classes.
* In the same year: JBend becomes the most valuable company at the NYSE after having introduced *smörebröd*, a framework to replace the visitor pattern in legacy java applications.
* 2106: A small bunch of java developers revolt in order to remove checked exceptions in the upcoming java 39. The rebellion is overthrown by the rest. At least they try.
