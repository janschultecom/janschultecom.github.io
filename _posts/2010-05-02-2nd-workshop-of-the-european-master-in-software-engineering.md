As last year, the students & alumni of the [ERASMUS MUNDUS](http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus_mundus/index_en.php "ERASMUS MUNDUS") [Master in European Software Engineering](http://emse.fi.upm.es/ "Master in European Software Engineering") are organizing a Workshop to unite all students from the four European partner universities and keep in touch with the alumni of previous batches. Since I am alumni and in the organization committee of this years workshop, I would like to use this blog post to promote the Workshop to interested people and invite them to join. Currently we are counting with 50 - 60 students, alumni, researchers and professionals from all over the world!
