During a research on whether a company needs a strategy or not to survive in the global market I came across this article in an issue of Harvard Business Review from October/September 2000\. In this article Ricardo Semler, the CEO of the brazilian based company Semco, describes how his company runs already successfully for more than 20 years without having a strategy.

This article is rather interesting since you can find a lot of information on how to do and implement a business strategy and why it is good to have one, but very few article about why not to have one.
