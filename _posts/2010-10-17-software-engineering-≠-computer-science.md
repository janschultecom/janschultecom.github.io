Today I came across a very interesting article (via the [SE Radio](http://www.se-radio.net/ "SE Radio") podcast) at [Dr. Dobb's](http://www.ddj.com/ "Dr. Dobb's") with the title _Software Engineering ≠ Computer Science_ by [_Chuck Connell_](http://www.beautifulsoftware.com/ "Chuck Connell"). As this is a discussion topic that happens to appear over and over again, I think it's a very interesting article that I really recommend to read.

Chuck draws the line between Software Engineering and Computer Science where the human comes into play. Thus, everything that requires human intervention (like requirements engineering, maintainability, etc.) is part of Software Engineering. On the other hand, things like algorithms, machine learning, etc. do not require human intervention and therefore belong to the field of Computer Science.

Based on this observation, Chuck formulates the thesis _Software engineering will never be a rigorous discipline with proven results, because it involves human activity._

Thus, he argues that _we should not try to make software engineering into an extension of mathematically-based computer science,_ while simultaneously computer science _will never be the whole story_ since software engineering also includes other facets such as _creativity, vision, multi-disciplinary thinking, and humanity._
